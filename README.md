# Miller-Rabin Primality Test

This Python project includes a Miller-Rabin primality test. The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is prime.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x

### Installing

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/01-00-11-00/miller-rabin-test.git
```

## Usage
To use the Miller-Rabin primality test, run the `main.py` script in your Python environment.

````bash
python main.py
````

You will be prompted to enter the number you want to test and the number of iterations for the Miller-Rabin test.
